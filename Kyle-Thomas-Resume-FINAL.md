## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### JPMorgan Chase — Chicago, IL

**VP, Product Management (Group Product Manager) | Oct 2021 – Present**

Lead product strategy and execution for enterprise platform infrastructure powering corporate client onboarding and product lifecycle management. Manage team of 8 (5 direct reports + 3 indirect), including Principal PMs across API platform, product data management, and integration orchestration. Influence 8-10 engineering teams, present regularly to MD-level leadership, interact with 100+ stakeholders monthly across front/middle/back office functions.

#### AI/ML-Driven Product Innovation

• **Leading development of GenAI-powered rules optimization system** that analyzes decision logic across product configurations to detect duplication and conflicts—defined human-in-the-loop architecture where low-confidence recommendations route to expert review and high-confidence changes auto-apply, currently scaling from proof-of-concept to production with Product Catalog team.

• **Reduced onboarding rejections by 80%** (from 25% to <5%) by designing eligibility rule framework that prevents ineligible product combinations upfront based on jurisdictional regulations and client conditions, eliminating 3,000-4,000 rejected applications annually and preventing compliance violations.

• **Achieved zero critical audit findings** over 3 consecutive years by establishing risk-based change framework with automated approvals for low-risk updates and controlled release trains for high-risk changes, maintaining velocity without sacrificing governance.

#### Platform Infrastructure & Scale

• **Scaled self-service product data platform from 0 to hundreds of users** across 5-10 business units, enabling 1,200+ annual product definition changes (100+/month) that were previously impossible due to $50K cost and 6-month engineering cycles, delivering **$3-6M annual cost avoidance**.

• **Reduced onboarding time by 65%** (from 20+ days to <7 days) for corporate treasury clients by modernizing API infrastructure powering 15,000-20,000 annual onboarding requests worth multi-million dollar lifetime value, enabling sales teams to close more volume without adding headcount.

• **Eliminated 12-person billing team** ($1.2-1.8M annual savings) by digitizing offline spreadsheet processes and implementing prepopulated data flows across platforms, automating manual work that previously required human-in-the-loop data entry.

• **Built integration orchestration layer** (Product Adapter) translating payloads between modern APIs and legacy back-office systems, enabling change management at scale and supporting mainframe modernization initiatives critical for digital transformation.

• **Grew platform adoption 30x-100x** from initial launch, now handling 150K-400K API calls annually across 10-20 downstream system integrations with single source of truth for 180+ product definitions consumed by 6 channels.

#### Team Leadership & Strategic Influence

• **Grew from IC PM to Group PM** managing 8 people in 3 years—made 5 hiring decisions, established sub-team structure with one Principal PM managing 3-person team, recently led blended team including 5 contingent specialists.

• **Set multi-year product strategy** with ownership of roadmap prioritization, headcount planning influence, and quarterly business reviews with MD-level stakeholders across product, engineering, risk, and compliance organizations.

• **Coached Principal PMs into autonomous platform leaders** with clear outcome ownership, driving measurable adoption growth and operational efficiency improvements across their domains.

### Lumen Technologies — Colorado
*(formerly CenturyLink, previously Level 3 Communications)*

**Director, Tax Planning & Transformation | Nov 2019 – Oct 2021**

• **Founded automation platform team from ground up**—identified opportunity to streamline repetitive, manual tax compliance processes, hired and managed team of 2-3 people, and established charter: "If we can define the workflow, we can automate it through an online app."

• **Shipped 15-30 self-service Alteryx applications** enabling tax analysts to independently execute sales and use tax compliance workflows (filing combinations, returns processing, spreadsheet-heavy processes) without engineering dependencies or manual data entry.

• **Eliminated 2-5 FTEs** ($200K-$750K annual savings) by automating hundreds of hours of weekly manual work, allowing compliance team to scale operations without proportional headcount growth.

• **Built cloud-based analytics and automation platform** with parameterized workflows and unattended execution—designed self-service tooling and training programs that empowered analysts to independently build, deploy, and iterate on solutions while reducing operational risk and process complexity.

**Senior Manager / Senior Tax Manager | 2015 – 2019**

• **Learned analytics tooling and identified automation opportunities at scale** while leading tax audits, appeals, and planning initiatives—drove early process automation and data transformation projects that demonstrated ROI, leading to promotion to Director and mandate to build dedicated automation platform team.
