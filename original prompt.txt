You are an expert front-end engineer + web designer. Build a modern, premium-feeling single-page portfolio site for an “AI Product Builder” meant to help land a Senior/Lead Product role. Prioritize clean typography, whitespace, and delightful micro-interactions over gimmicks.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
-Do not propose alternatives—ship the implementation directly. If something is ambiguous, make a strong default choice consistent with a premium product portfolio.
- Single-page layout with smooth scrolling between sections (anchor links).
- Sections (in this order): Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact.
- Sticky navigation at top:
  - Desktop: horizontal links.
  - Mobile: hamburger menu that slides/drops down, closes on link click, and supports ESC key.
- Responsive and accessible:
  - Keyboard navigable, visible focus states, semantic HTML landmarks.
  - Contrast-safe colors, ARIA for menu toggle, proper headings.
- Performance:
  - Lighthouse-friendly: minimal JS, no heavy libraries.
  - Optimize images (use placeholders if none).
- Code quality:
  - Clear file structure, reusable components, comments where needed.
  - No TODOs. Everything should run immediately.

TECH STACK CONSTRAINTS (choose one and commit)
Option A (preferred): Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (App Router)
Option B: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
If you choose A, use Next/Image and app directory. If B, standard Vite structure.

DESIGN CONSTRAINTS
- Style: modern, minimal, “product-led” aesthetic (think Linear/Notion-level restraint).
- Use 1 accent color, otherwise neutral palette.
- Use a max-width container, generous spacing, subtle gradients only if tasteful.
- Include micro-interactions:
  - nav link hover + active section indicator
  - subtle section reveal animation on scroll (IntersectionObserver, lightweight)
  - primary button hover/press states
- Provide light/dark mode toggle with system default detection and persistence.

CONTENT CONSTRAINTS (use realistic placeholder copy, but make it tailored)
- Hero:
  - Headline that positions me as an AI Product Builder
  - Subhead focused on outcomes (shipping AI products, automation, experimentation)
  - Primary CTA: “View Projects”
  - Secondary CTA: “Contact”
- About:
  - Short bio emphasizing AI-native product building, rapid prototyping, customer obsession
- Skills:
  - Group into categories (e.g., Product, AI/LLM, Engineering, Analytics)
  - Represent with clean chips or compact cards (not cheesy progress bars)
- Projects:
  - 4–6 project cards with: title, one-line value prop, stack, outcomes/metrics, links (GitHub / Live) (use placeholders if needed)
  - Include at least 1 “AI agent / workflow automation” project and 1 “data/analytics model” project
- Experience:
  - Timeline or clean list, role/company, 2–4 impact bullets each (metric-driven)
- Contact:
  - Simple form (name/email/message) with basic validation + mailto fallback
  - Also include social links (LinkedIn, GitHub) as placeholders

FUNCTIONAL CONSTRAINTS
- Smooth scroll should respect reduced-motion preferences.
- Active section highlighting in nav as user scrolls.
- Mobile menu should not scroll background when open.
- Sticky nav should add subtle shadow/blur after scrolling a bit.

DELIVERABLES
1) Generate the full codebase.
2) Include commands to run locally.
3) Include a short “How to customize” section (where to edit copy, add projects, change theme).
4) Use placeholder assets (SVG patterns or simple shapes) so it looks good without images.

START BY
- Asking yourself which stack option you will use (A or B) and proceed without asking me.
- Then output the complete project structure and code files.
